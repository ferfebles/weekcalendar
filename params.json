{"name":"Weekcalendar","tagline":"Simple & light week view calendar","body":"# Why #\r\n\r\nI'm a systems engineer that writes a lot of code: we have more than 50.000 computers, 1.100 servers and 900 remote offices.\r\nBasically, I manage systems by writing code.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm not very good with my to-do lists: half the time learning, testing and sharing (procrastinating?), the other half absolutely immersed in solving just one problem (sometimes not the most important one).\r\n\r\nA few years ago I started to read some articles and books about productivity, delivering on time, lean... and began to practice one of the simplest methods: the pommodoro technique.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to apply in any environment, and it just works. If you haven't heard about it, take a look at http://www.pommodorotechnique.com\r\n\r\nBut the pommodoro technique works mainly in the \"To Do Today\" mode, and I've always liked to work with the whole week picture.\r\nOn one hand, it gives me context: the work of today is usually related with the previous days.\r\nOn the other, you can see how this week is going: done tasks from previous days give you peace of mind, and unfinished ones propell you to work harder or to redefine your project schedule.\r\n\r\nSo, I started to look for something that I could use as a week calendar, and where I could use some pommodorish technique: just to write down the work that needs to be done today, and track the tasks' progress.\r\n\r\nYou can imagine that I found nothing that I liked. So, I started to think about the week calendar that I would love to use...\r\n\r\nThe design, was driven by simplicity:\r\n1. Only one font.\r\n2. No graphics, only chars and dots.\r\n3. No colours, just black and only three shades of grey.\r\n4. It could be used with the pommodoro technique.\r\n5. All week view, but with a size as small as possible.\r\n6. Half cm. non invasive grid, that can be used as a ruler\r\n7. All possible space to you (avoid adding unneeded elements).\r\n8. Days on the right, you can write one line up\r\n\r\nThe result, being a programmer with almost no free time, was a little script written in Ruby, and using the prawn gem that allows you to write PDF documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
