# Why #

I started to look for a week calendar where I could use some 'pomodorish' technique: just to write down the work that needs to be done today, and track the tasks' progress. I thought that this could be a simple and interesting gift for some relatives this Christmas... Well, it ended not to being so simple!.

You can imagine that I found nothing that I liked. So, I started to think about the week calendar that I would love to use and give... [Week Calendar](http://ferfebles.github.io/weekcalendar/)
